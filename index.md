i'm mae, host of a relatively new system, the other people here are bunne, who's a little young, and sammy, who's a little angry.

we are survivors of [csa]{title="childhood sexual assault"}, emotional abuse & neglect and bullying. we're autistic, have adhd and most likely cptsd and possibly bpd, tho we're undiagnosed because life sucks like that.

i'm very anxious around groups of people, and rejection sensitive.

bunne is around 7 and very scared of being hurt by people, she survived csa, escaped but found bullying and scorn instead of love and support. it broke her.

## sammy

sammy is the same age as mae, she became who she had to be to survive, is extremely self negative and struggles to be angry at other people instead preferring to take it out on herself.

mae isn't sure if she's the original host, if sammy split from her, or she split from sammy. either way, mae is here to fight fires and try to find a way to help herself and the others.
